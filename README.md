> **A blazingly fast, privacy-first chat interface for AI that works with any LLM provider—cloud or completely offline.**

Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, or run completely offline with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) or [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or even [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). Your conversations stay local in on your machine. No vendor lock-in, no tracking, full control.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Click Docker Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1337hero/faster-next-chat.git
cd faster-next-chat
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Open http://localhost:8787, register your first user (becomes admin), and configure your AI providers.

**With HTTPS** (for production):
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d
```

### Local Development

**Prerequisites**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js 20+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1337hero/faster-next-chat.git
cd faster-next-chat
bun install
bun run dev
```

**On first run**, the server automatically generates encryption keys and initializes the database.

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:3001

> **Important**: Backup `server/.env` - contains the encryption key for stored API keys.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Register an account** at http://localhost:3000/login
   - The first account is automatically promoted to admin
2. **Configure AI providers** in the Admin Panel (`/admin` → Providers tab):
   - Add OpenAI, Anthropic, or other cloud providers with API keys
   - Configure local providers (Ollama, LM Studio) with custom endpoints
   - API keys are encrypted and stored securely server-side
3. **Enable models** in the Admin Panel (Providers tab → Refresh Models)
   - Select which models appear in the chat interface
   - Set default model for new chats

![Available Models](models.png)
*Enable and manage models from all your providers*

![New Focus Mode](focus-mode.png)
*New Focus Mode*

![Themes](themes.png)
*New Apperance Options, to change colors and fonts*

![White Labeling](white-label.png)
*You can now white label and customize the app title and icon*


### Using Offline with Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# In Faster Chat: Admin Panel → Connections → Search "Ollama" → Add
# Then: Admin Panel → Models → Click "Pull Model" on Ollama row → Enter model name
```

You can pull models directly from the Admin Panel—no CLI needed! Just click **Pull Model** next to your Ollama provider, enter a model name (e.g., `llama3.2`, `mistral`, `codellama`), and watch the download progress in real-time.

The Provider Hub auto-discovers 50+ providers including Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, and more. Just search and add.

## 💻 Development

### Commands

**Root (recommended)**
```bash
bun run dev         # Start frontend + backend concurrently
bun run build       # Build all packages for production
bun run start       # Run production builds
bun run clean       # Remove all build artifacts
bun run format      # Format code with Prettier
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
bun run dev         # Vite dev server on :3000
bun run build       # Production build to dist/
bun run preview     # Preview production build
```

**Backend**
```bash
cd server
bun run dev         # Hono dev server on :3001
bun run build       # Build for production
bun run start       # Run production server on :3001
```

## 🐳 Docker Details

The Docker setup uses a hybrid build (Bun for deps, Node.js 22 runtime) with SQLite storage in a persistent volume.

**HTTPS with Caddy**: For production with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d
# Edit Caddyfile with your domain, point DNS, restart
```

See `docs/caddy-https-setup.md` and `docs/docker-setup.md` for details.

### OIDC/SSO Configuration

For enterprise single sign-on with any OIDC provider, see **[docs/OIDC_SETUP.md](docs/OIDC_SETUP.md)** for complete setup instructions supporting:
- Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, Azure AD/Entra ID, Google Workspace
- Automatic configuration discovery via `.well-known/openid-configuration`
- Works alongside local username/password authentication

### Configuration

**Environment Variables** (`server/.env`):

```bash
# Required: Encryption key for API keys
API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...  # Generate with crypto.randomBytes(32)

# Optional: Configure via Admin Panel instead
APP_PORT=8787              # Internal port (default: 8787)
NODE_ENV=production        # Environment mode
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app/server/data/chat.db

# For local Ollama access from Docker
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

**Common Commands:**

```bash
docker compose up -d                # Start
docker compose logs -f              # View logs
docker compose down                 # Stop
docker compose up -d --build        # Rebuild

# Reset database
docker compose down
docker volume rm faster-chat_chat-data
docker compose up -d
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Faster Chat** is built on these principles:

- **Self-Hosted**: Your data stays on your server. No cloud dependencies.
- **Provider-Agnostic**: Never locked into a single AI vendor.
- **Minimal Runtime**: 3KB Preact, no SSR overhead, instant responses.
- **Offline-Capable**: Run completely offline with local models.
- **Fast Iteration**: Bun for speed, no TypeScript ceremony, clear patterns.
- **Simple Code**: Small focused components, derive state in render, delete aggressively.

### Why No TypeScript?

We chose **speed over ceremony**. TypeScript's compile step and constant type churn across fast-moving AI SDKs slowed development more than it helped.

**Our guardrails:**
- Runtime validation at system boundaries
- Shared constants and clear contracts
- Tests for critical paths
- JSDoc for complex functions

**Trade-off:** Less friction, faster iteration, easier contribution.

See WIKI for detailed coding principles and architecture documentation.

## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgments

**Faster Chat** is built on the shoulders of excellent open source projects:

**Core Infrastructure**
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai) - Streaming chat completions and multi-provider support
- [models.dev](https://github.com/sst/models.dev) - Community-maintained AI model database for auto-discovery
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) - Lightweight 3KB React alternative
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - Ultrafast web framework for the backend
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) & [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) - Modern routing and server state management
- [bun:sqlite](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite) - Fast SQLite driver for server-side persistence

**UI & Styling**
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [lucide-preact](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-preact) - Beautiful icon library
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) - Soothing pastel theme

**External API Calls**

For transparency, this application makes the following external API calls:
- **models.dev/api.json** - Fetches provider and model metadata on server startup (cached for 1 hour)
- **Your configured AI providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) - Only when you send chat messages
- **No tracking, analytics, or telemetry services** - Your privacy is paramount

All data (conversations, settings, API keys) is stored in your self-hosted SQLite database. Nothing leaves your server except API calls to your configured AI providers.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome! We're looking for:
- Bug fixes and error handling
- New provider integrations
- Documentation improvements
- UI/UX enhancements <-- I'm a frontend dev w/ an eye for design but not a DESIGNER - if you ARE! HELP!
- Tests and quality improvements

**Before submitting:**
1. Read Documention for coding philosophy and patterns
2. Ensure changes align with our lightweight, offline-first approach
3. Test locally with `bun run dev`
4. Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
